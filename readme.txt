CAPTCHA's suck.  At Are You a Human, we are making games to fight bots with fun. Please try out our beta!

== Description ==

This is the Beta release of the Are You A Human WordPress plugin. We are actively developing both the plugin and the PlayThru itself.

It might not work everywhere, all the time, but we think it is good enough to start letting people test-drive it.

Our PlayThru solves the two main problems with CAPTCHAs: terrible user experience and lousy security.

Our PlayThru is more simple, intuitive, and fun for people because it uses games that are easy to figure out for humans, but difficult for bots.  We collect lots of data about how a visitor plays our game, which we feed into our algorithm to continuously improve our security. The combination of interaction plus multiple games makes PlayThru a superior verification solution.

We love feedback, so please tell us how to make PlayThru better at [http://support.areyouahuman.com]("http://support.areyouahuman.com").

Thanks and fight bots with fun.
