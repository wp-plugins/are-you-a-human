PlayThru, created by Are You a Human, replaces the awful user experience of normal CAPTCHA with short and simple games.

== Description ==

PlayThru [pley throo] noun

1. The next evolution of online human verification and the best CAPTCHA replacement around.
1. A CAPTCHA alternative that stops bots with fun, by focusing on being simple and intuitive.

PlayThru, created by Are You a Human, replaces the awful user experience of normal CAPTCHA with short and simple games.  Instead of the twisted and distorted CAPTCHA text, PlayThru's games are fun for your users.

PlayThru is free to use on your site. 

PlayThru now works with Contact Form 7 and Gravity forms! PlayThru is automatically integrated with Contact Form 7 or Gravity Forms, all you need to do is add it within the form builder. 

Our games take 5 to 10 seconds to complete, versus the 12 second average of CAPTCHA.  PlayThru also increases form submissions by up to 40% over other CAPTCHA options like reCaptcha.  We serve games in both HTML5 and Flash.  We use six layers of security to fight the bots.  We collect data on how a visitor plays our game, which we then feed into our algorithm to continuously improve our security.
