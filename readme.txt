Stop spam with a fun game instead of distorted text! PlayThru works effortlessly on blog comments, registration screens, lost password forms, and more.

== Description ==

Stop spam and bots with PlayThru, the fun, free CAPTCHA alternative! CAPTCHAs infuriate users, increase drop-off, and ruin your site's user experience. PlayThru is the simple game-based CAPTCHA replacement that people love. It's easy to install and completely free.

This plugin works effortlessly on comment, registration, and lost password forms, and is compatible with BuddyPress, Gravity Forms, and Contact Form 7. CAPTCHA-related dropoff is five times higher on mobile than on desktop, and the PlayThru spam blocker is optimized for touch, so it works beautifully on mobile devices.

Case Study: Spam Annihilated at VoteSane

VoteSane (www.votesane.com) experimented with a variety of CAPTCHA options, including logic CAPTCHAs ("What color is a banana?"), math CAPTCHAs ("What's 6 + 8?"), and traditional text-based CAPTCHAs to address their spam problem. But nothing helped. No matter what they did, they were besieged with twelve to fifteen thousand spam comments a month, all of which had to be cleared out manually.

Then they discovered PlayThru. In the first month after switching to PlayThru, VoteSane didn't receive a single spam comment. Thatâ€™s right: PlayThru cut their monthly comment spam from the tens of thousands down to zero. Plus, PlayThru completely eliminated the complaints about poor user experience that VoteSane routinely received with CAPTCHA.
