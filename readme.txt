CAPTCHA's suck.  Are You a Human’s PlayThru is a CAPTCHA alternative that replaces the twisted, distorted text with games.

== Description ==

PlayThru replaces the awful user experience of normal CAPTCHAs with short and simple games.  They are easy for your users and difficult for bots to break.

Are You a Human’s PlayThru provides security for your site’s comments and registration sections.  It is easy to install and difficult for spammers to circumvent.  We collect lots of data about how a visitor plays our game, which we feed into our algorithm to continuously improve our security.  Please learn more about PlayThru at the [Are You a Human website](http://areyouahuman.com).

Installing PlayThru requires a Publisher Key, which can be acquired from the Are You a Human publisher portal.  To get your publisher key, please create an account on our [registration page](http://areyouahuman.com/signup).
