Captcha's suck. Are You A Human is trying to made a captcha that your visitors might actually enjoy using. Try out our beta!

== Description ==

This is the Beta release of the Are You A Human wordpress plugin.

We are actively developing both the plugin and the PlayThru itself.

It might not work everywhere, all the time, but we think it's good enough to start letting people test-drive it.

Our PlayThru solves two problems: Humans hate captchas and bots are good at breaking them.

We collect lots of data about how a visitor plays the game, which gives us many more dimensions to feed into our algorithm. We think that will make it more difficult for spammers. At the same time, we're trying to make games that people might actually enjoy playing.
